A Sintra Version of the PHP Server 
- Tested with Sinatra 1.0
- Needed Gems: json, haml and plist

How to add a new application version:
- Create a subdirectory with the bundle identifier string as the name on the server (if it does not exist yet)
- Copy the provisioning profile into that subdirectory, it is important to have the extension ".mobileprovision" (mandatory file)
- Start XCode
- Invoke "Build and Archive"
- Open the Organizer
- Choose "Archived Applications"
- Select the build you want to publish
- Select "Share application"
- Select "Distribute for Enterprise..."
- Enter a dummy URL in the URL Field (this is replaced by the Sinatra Server)
- Enter a title, this will be shown in the web interface and on the client
- Version number will be taken automatically from the generated plist file
- Note: The client does not check if the version number is actually a bigger number, it only checks if they are different, which should be fine anyway
- Save it, two files will be saved, one .plist and one .ipa
- Upload the plist file into the subdirectory under public/apps on the server, it is important to have the extension ".plist" (mandatory)
- Upload the application file into the subdirectory under public/apps on the server, it is important to have the extension ".ipa" (mandatory)
- If you don't want this application to appear in the web interface, add a file named "private" (optional)
- If you want to add release information to the web interface and the client, add a file with the extension ".html" which contains the release information as HTML (without header and body)
- Note: If one of the mandatory files do not exist in the directory, the update or installation will not be made available
